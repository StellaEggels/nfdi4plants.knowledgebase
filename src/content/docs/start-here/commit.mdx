    How can I make sure, other researchers will understand what I did while working on my ARC?

## Track changes

The ARC comes with a mechanism to track changes. This version control is based on [git](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/version-control-git). Briefly, snapshots of an ARC are called `Commits`. Every Commit is encoded with the information on **who** made the change and **when** and it is accompanied with a note, i.e. a "Commit message" that allows the user to communicate what was changed.

:::note
Commits would usually be done more frequently along the previous steps described in this `start here` guide.

### Login to DataHUB

In order to retreive your user information and associate it with your commits, you need to login to the DataHUB.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
    <Steps>
        
    1. Click `Login` in the sidebar.
    2. Select `git.nfdi4plants.org` as DataHUB from the dropdown menu.
    3. Click `Login`. 

        :::note
        This automatically opens your browser at the DataHUB (https://git.nfdi4plants.org) and asks you to login. If you are not already logged in at the DataHUB, you can directly return to ARCitect. Otherwise you need to login first.
        :::

        :::note
        The first time you login using ARCitect from a new computer, you are asked to authorize this computer's ARCitect to communicate with your DataHUB account.

        Great, now I have some new functions activated in the sidebar. What are they for?

### Commit your changes

The commit menu allows you to "commit" your changes locally. This saves the changes of your local ARC together with your DataHUB credentials (Name and eMail).

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
    <Steps>
    
    1. Navigate to the `Commit` menu.
    2. Since you are logged in, the `Name` and `eMail` of your DataHUB account are automatically added.
    3. Add a commit message:

        <ViolaSays>
            "Created my first ARC and added data."
        </ViolaSays>
    3. Click `Commit` to store your changes locally.
        
    </Steps>

### History menu

In the History menu you can inspect your ARC history with all commit messages.

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
    <Steps>
    
    1. Navigate to the `History` menu.
    2. Find your commit messages.

        <ViolaSays>
            Great, so even in five years I will know what I did in every step.
        </ViolaSays>

## Try it yourself â€“ add messages to communicate your ARC's evolution

We recommend adding a message that shortly summarizes, what you did since you last synced your ARC, e.g.

<Steps>

1. Viola starts a fresh ARC for her project

    <ViolaSays>
      initialize ARC structure
    </ViolaSays>

2. She adds folders for her study and assay

    <ViolaSays>
      add folder structure
    </ViolaSays>

3. She adds raw data to an RNASeq assay

    <ViolaSays>
      add RNAseq dataset
    </ViolaSays>

4. She annotates the dataset using Swate 

    <ViolaSays>
      annotate RNAseq samples
    </ViolaSays>

</Steps>

    <Steps>
    
    1. Make some small changes to your ARC like adding or editing a text file.
    2. Navigate to the `Commit` menu.
    3. Add a commit message:

        <ViolaSays>
            "Add a README to include some notes"
        </ViolaSays>
    3. Click `Commit` to store your changes locally.
    4. Check the `History`
