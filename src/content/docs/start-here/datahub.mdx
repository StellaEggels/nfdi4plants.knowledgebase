<ViolaSays>
          Now I have created my local ARC, but how can I share it with my colleagues?
</ViolaSays>

ARCs are the basis of the collaborative research platform and can be seamlessly shared between researchers by using the PLANTDataHUB.

## Upload your ARC to the PLANTDataHUB

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
    <Steps>
    1. From the sidebar, navigate to the `DataHUB Sync` menu.

    3. In the `Add Remote` dialog, leave the defaults for `Remote Name`, `DataHUB Account` and `URL`.

        By default, your ARC will be synced privately to your personal DataHUB Account.
        :::

        <ViolaSays>
          So my ARC will be synced to https://git.nfdi4plants.org/viola/AthalianaColdStressSugar.git

    4. Click `Add Remote`.
    5. Click `Push` to upload your ARC to the DataHUB.

## Add members to your ARC
    <ViolaSays>
     Now my ARC is stored in the PLANTDataHUB, but how can I add my project partner?
    </ViolaSays>

<Card icon="gitlab" title="PLANTDataHUB">
    <Steps>

    1. Click on **Manage** in the left navigation panel.
    2. Click on **Members**.
    3. Click on **Invite members**.
    4. Search for potential collaborators.
    5. Select a role.

        :::note[Choosing the proper role]
        When inviting new members to an ARC or group, you can choose between different levels.
        :::

        :::note
        By default you are **Owner** of an ARC you create or upload to the DataHUB.
        :::  

    </Steps>
</Card>


## DataHUB Roles

When inviting new members to an ARC or group, you can choose between different roles.

- **Guest** &ndash; Has the least rights. They will not be able to see the content of an ARC (only the wiki page).
- **Reporter** &ndash; Has read access to your ARC. This is recommended for people you ask for consultancy.
- **Developer** &ndash; The choice for most people you want to invite to your ARC. Developers have read and write access, but cannot maintain the project on the DataHUB, e.g. invite new members.
- **Maintainer** &ndash; Has read and write access and can add or remove members, except for yourself. This is the minimum role recommended for inviting group leaders as it allows them to add their group members for data upload or analysis to the project.
- **Owner** &ndash; An owner has basically all rights to the ARC. They can delete or transfer the ARC and manage user memberships.

    :::note
        If you are interested in details about permissions and roles have a look [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html).

 <ViolaSays>
     I will invite my PI Prof. Jasmine Beetroot as **Maintainer** and my collaboration partner Oliver Sage as **Developer**.
