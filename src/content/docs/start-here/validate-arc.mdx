<ViolaSays>
The ARC offers a lot of flexibility in how I structure my data and annotation.
How can I make sure that it is intact or holds enough data to be published and receive a DOI?
</ViolaSays>

Your ARC can be validated in the PLANTDataHUB against a selection of validation packages.
For instance, you can validate the ARC
1. against the `arc_specification` – to make sure that your ARC is intact
2. against the `invenio` requirements – Invenio is the basis of DataPLANT's publication service

## Add validation to your ARC

You can simply select the validation via ARCitect.

    <Steps>

    1. Open the ARC in ARCitect
    2. In the sidebar, go to the `Validation` menu
    3. Check the box next to the `arc_specification` dropdown
    3. In the section "Custom Validation Packages", select the `invenio` package
    4. Select the latest version for both packages and click `Save`
    4. Commit your changes via the `Commit` menu
    5. Upload your changes via the `DataHUB Sync` menu
    6. Open your ARC in the DataHUB

    </Steps>

## Check the validation results

The validation is being run in the PLANTDataHUB, where you can also find the validation results.

    <Steps>

    1. Sign in to the [PLANTDataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org)
    2. Navigate to the validated ARC
    3. In the right sidebar you find several validation badges (e.g. `arc specification` and `invenio`)
    4. Click on the `arc specification` badge to explore the test results.

    </Steps>

The validation tests check many things, but cannot catch everything. Whenever you are getting ready to publish an ARC, we suggest you have a look at our [guide for reviewing your ARC](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/guides/review-arc)
