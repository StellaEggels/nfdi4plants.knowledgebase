The following practices support FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data analysis. They apply regardless of workflow format or tooling, and help ensure that your work can be **replicated, reproduced, or reused** – by yourself or others, in the future or in new contexts.

## Follow the KISS principle – **"Keep It Single-Step"**. 

- Each script should ideally perform only one distinct task.
- Avoid mixing unrelated processes in a single script.
- This improves:
  - Reusability across projects
  - Understandability of the script’s purpose
  - Clarity around its inputs and outputs- A focused script is easier to reuse, understand, and annotate, especially regarding the `inputs` it consumes and the `outputs` it creates

## Separate data analysis logic from data
    
- Avoid hard-coded paths or filenames.
- Parameterize inputs, outputs, and configuration as arguments.
- Benefits:
  - Easier reuse across datasets and platforms
  - Smoother integration into larger workflows or pipelines

## Collect information about dependencies

- Record the script language (e.g. Python, R, Bash)
- List all external packages, libraries, and software tools used
- Specify versions where applicable
- List runtime environments and hardware requirements (if relevant)
- Include useful metadata:
  - Official citation
  - URLs (e.g. docs, GitHub, project websites)
  - Unique identifiers from registries such as 
    - [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/)
    - [RRIDs via SciCrunch](https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/resource)
    - [identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org/)

## Uncouple processes from the execution environment

- Ensure that your analysis can be run anywhere, not just on your machine.
- Use containerization (e.g., Docker, Singularity) to bundle:
  - Dependencies
  - Correct versions
  - Required system tools
- Use existing community-maintained containers where possible, e.g.
  - [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro/)
  - [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- This makes your analysis portable and reproducible across different systems.
