## Review your ARC

<ViolaSays>
The validation tests pass, what else should I check before submitting my ARC for publication?
</ViolaSays>



### Check the ARC repository on DataHUB

<Card icon="pen" title="DataHUB repository">
    <Steps>

    1. Open your ARC on [PLANTDataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org)
    2. Is the name of the repository descriptive?
    3. Check the icon behind the repository name. The visibility should be set to public. You can change the visibility under `Settings -> General -> Visibility, project features, permissions`
    4. Check the `README.md`, does it contain useful information? This is the first thing people will see when they look at your ARC on DataHUB.
    5. Does your repository have a `LICENSE` file? In the panel on the right you will find a button to add a license. There are many license templates available to choose from. We recommend an open license such as `MIT` or `Creative Commons`
    5. Check the **Project Storage** on the right side. Is most of the storage space LFS storage?

    </Steps>

### Check the ARC (e.g. in ARCitect)

Next, open the ARC itself, and run through everything one last time. Or ask somebody else to have a look at your ARC to make sure it's understandable.

<Card icon="pen" title="Investigation">
    <Steps>
    1. Are the title and description clear and useful?
    2. Check the contacts. Anybody missing? Is all the data (name, email, ORCiD) for the contacts correct and complete?


    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Studies">
For each study in your ARC, check that:
    <Steps>
    1. Is the study metadata correct, complete and informative?
    2. Check all the annotation tables
       - Are the columns using ontology terms where possible?
       - Are the column types (e.g. characteristic, parameter) correct?
       - Check the input column header, does it match what is in the column? This can be `Input[Source Name]`, `Input[Sample Name]`, `Input[Material]`, or `Input[Data]`
       - Do columns have units (where applicable)?
       - Are there columns missing? Is the data fully described?
    3. Are there protocol documents in the `protocols` folder? If so, are they referenced somewhere via a `ProtocolREF` column?

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Assays">
For each assay in your ARC, check that:
    <Steps>
    1. Is the assay metadata correct, complete and informative?
       - Is the technology metadata set?
    2. Check all the annotation tables
       - Are the columns using ontology terms where possible?
       - Are the column types (e.g. characteristic, parameter) correct?
       - Check the input column header, does it match what is in the column? This can be `Input[Source Name]`, `Input[Sample Name]`, `Input[Material]`, or `Input[Data]`
       - Do columns have units (where applicable)?
       - Are there columns missing? Is the data fully described?
    3. Are there protocol documents in the `protocols` folder? If so, are they referenced somewhere via a `ProtocolREF` column?
    4. Check the `dataset` folder, is the data organised in a good way?

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Runs and Workflows">
    <Steps>
    1. TODO
    2. Was any reference data used in the analysis? is it clear where this came from?

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="All together">
To check the overall consistency of your ARC, make sure that the full connection from sample to raw data to processed data is there.
    <Steps>
    1. For every sample, can you trace it through the ARC?
       - Is there a path from one annotation table (input column to output column), to another annotation table where the input column matches the output column of a previous step's table?

    </Steps>
</Card>
