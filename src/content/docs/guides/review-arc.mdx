## Reviewing your ARC before publication

Before an ARC can be published, it must clearly and completely describe the data it contains. In this guide we outline things to consider before before submitting your ARC for publication.

### Check the ARC repository on DataHUB

First, check the ARC's top level information:

<Card icon="pen" title="DataHUB repository">
    <Steps>

    1. Open your ARC on [PLANTDataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org)
    2. Is the name of the repository descriptive?
    3. Check the icon behind the repository name. The visibility should be set to public. You can change the visibility under `Settings -> General -> Visibility, project features, permissions` (This is currently the best way to ensure that the people reviewing the corresponding publication have access to the ARC.)
    4. Check the `README.md`, does it contain useful information? This is the first thing people will see when they look at your ARC on DataHUB and is a useful way to 'orientate' the viewer in the ARC. (However, be sure that any important information in the README is also contained within the actual ARC structure in order to adhere to the ISA framework.)
    5. Does your repository have a `LICENSE` file? In the panel on the right you will find a button to add a license. There are many license templates available to choose from. We recommend an open license such as `MIT` or `Creative Commons`
    6. Check the **Project Storage** on the right side. Is most of the storage space LFS storage?

    </Steps>

### Check the ARC (e.g. in ARCitect)

Next, open the ARC itself, and run through everything one last time, or else ask a freind or colleauge to have a look at your ARC to make sure it's understandable.

<Card icon="pen" title="Investigation">
    <Steps>
    1. Are the title and description clear and useful?
    2. Check the contacts. Are all collaborators included? Is all data (name, email, ORCiD) for the contacts correct and complete?


    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Studies">
For each study in your ARC, check that:
    <Steps>
    1. The study metadata is correct, complete and informative.
    2. Within all annotation tables:
       - Columns use ontology terms where possible.
       - Column types (e.g. characteristic, parameter) are correct.
       - Input column headers match the 'type' of input in the column (this can be `Input[Source Name]`, `Input[Sample Name]`, `Input[Material]`, or `Input[Data]`).
       - Columns have units (where applicable).
       - There are no missing columns.
       - The data is fully described.
    3. There are protocol documents in the `protocols` folder AND they are referenced in the corresponding annotation sheet via a `ProtocolREF` column.

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Assays">
For each assay in your ARC, check that:
    <Steps>
    1. The assay metadata is correct, complete and informative, including the technology metadata.
    2. Within all annotation tables:
       - Columns use ontology terms where possible.
       - Column types (e.g. characteristic, parameter) are correct.
       - Input column headers match the 'type' of input in the column (this can be `Input[Source Name]`, `Input[Sample Name]`, `Input[Material]`, or `Input[Data]`).
       - Columns have units (where applicable).
       - There are no missing columns.
       - The data is fully described.
    3.There are protocol documents in the `protocols` folder AND they are referenced in the corresponding annotation sheet via a `ProtocolREF` column.
    4. The data contained in the `dataset` folder is organised in and understandable way.

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="Runs and Workflows">
    <Steps>
    1. TODO

    2. Was any reference data used in the analysis? is it clear where this came from?

    </Steps>
</Card>

<Card icon="pen" title="All together">
To check the overall consistency of your ARC, make sure that the full connection from sample to raw data to processed data is there.
    <Steps>
    1. For every sample, can you trace it through the ARC?
       - Is there a path from one annotation table (input column to output column), to another annotation table where the input column matches the output column of a previous step's table? A mermaid graph is a quick way to check that every output in connected to a subsequent input.
